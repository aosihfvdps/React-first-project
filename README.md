### This is a website project built on React.js. I built this project along with the course Database.

Throughout this project, I learned:
* React.js
* SQL
* Supabase
* Postman
* The basics of JSON, EJS, Markdown, and JavaScript

*This is not the original repo that I built along with the course but a new one, because I want to hide my api keys.*
